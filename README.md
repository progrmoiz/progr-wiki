## Cloning the repo

If you have a high-bandwidth connection, I recommend starting with a fresh clone of the repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/progrmoiz/progr-wiki.git
```

## Getting set up
The progrwiki simplifies the list dependencies. Ensure you have a recent version of Node and the AppEngine SDK for Python already installed.
1. Run `npm install` (needed for the build process)

### Start Local Server

To view the site locally, just run:

```
npm start
```
